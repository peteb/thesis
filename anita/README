A little parser that eats a simple object language and spits out a
JSON AST.

To build run: make anita.
To try run: bin/anita test/Test.anita

src     -- source files including the grammar
bin     -- script to parse an anita-file
classes -- compiled Java classes
lib     -- ANTLR and JSON jars
test    -- test files containg examples of anita source

The parser is generated by ANTLR: antlr.org
The semantic actions build an AST using JSON objects: json.org
The surrounding simple "compiler" code is written in Java
