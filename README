Read INSTALL for help on building thorn-llvm!

Directory listing:
        /llvm-2.6/		-- full source code for llvm-2.6.
                                           ./configure && make && make clean
                                   sorry, I've removed this. Too big. Just get LLVM
                                   somewhere else and build it with exceptions.

        /gc-7.1/		-- Boehm's garbage collector

        /experiments/	-- a playground for trying out fun things
        /src/				-- base folder for thorn-llvm compiler code
        /src/libthorn/  -- thorn runtime library
        /libs/			-- external libraries
        /tests/			-- stuff in here might or might not work
        /utests/		-- unit tests. they should work.
        /jsoncpp/               -- json parser, build it using the old SCons version
                                   and manually install the lib file built
        /anita/                 -- anita parser, outputs ast as json

To compile stuff using bundled llvm:
        Examine compile script in /experiments/first/; it makes use of the
        /llvm-config script which generates flags for gcc using currently available
        llvm base, prefering local (/llvm-2.6) over global.

        :: thorn-llvm is now using autotools, but it's not 100% yet.
