Building thorn-llvm:
	(it shouldn't be too hard, though it might take a lot of time; don't 
	forget the -j option in make!)
	
	First, compile llvm
		cd llvm-2.6
		./configure && make

		Note: LLVM doesn't seem to default to x86_64 on Mac OS X,
	  	use ./configure --target x86_64 if there are mismatching archs
		when building thorn-llvm.
		
		There's no need to install LLVM globally; the local version will 
		be used. If no local version is present, it will look for a 
		global install.
		
	Then compile Boehm's gc
		cd gc-7.1
		./configure --enable-threads=posix && make
		
	Finally, we can build thorn-llvm!
		./autogen.sh	 if the configure script doesn't exist yet
		./configure && make && sudo make install 
		
		This will install the binary (tlc) and the man page.
